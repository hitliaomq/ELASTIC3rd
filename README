FUNCTIONS
================
Elastic3rd is an open source academic free software
It is designed for calculating third-order elastic constan(TOECs)
   of arbitrary symmetry.

FEATURES
================
1. It can calculate the TOECs for arbitrary 3D crystal symmetry, 
   from isotropic to triclinic system.
2. This code is well modularized. Thus, the energy can be 
   calculatedusing other energy-calculate packages(only CASTEP 
   and VASP interfaces are provided in the original code) only 
   by writing few functions. The details of this function are 
   listed in the manual.
3. This code is written by python, so it supports multi-systems
   (windows and linux), which is dependent on your first
   principles code.
4. It supplies the continue mode, which will be quite useful 
   when your job is interrupted by unexpected crash.

TODO
================
1. Now, it only support strain-energy method, the strain-stress 
   method, which is more efficient is under development.
2. Find the symmetry automatically


REQUIRES
================
  python, numpy, scipy, matplotlib

INSTALL
================
  Just run "python setup.py install"

GETTING STARTED
================
When the input files of first-principles code(e.g. *.cell and 
   *.param for CASTEP) and INPUT file are prepared, then open 
   python in the destination folder, run the following code:

     import elastic3rd.elastic
     elastic3rd.elastic.elastic3()
   or
     using the test.py file provide in the example folder
     python test.py
